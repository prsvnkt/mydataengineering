## Introduction to SQL
---

Structured Query Language (SQL) is the standard language used to interact with databases. It allows users to create, manipulate, and query data stored in a RDBMS. SQL has become the backbone of many software applications, enabling efficient data handling, from small-scale personal databases to large-scale enterprise systems.

Some functions of SQL include: 
- Creation and modification of database structures like tables, indexes, and schemas
- Used to insert, update, delete, and retrieve data from a database
- SQL's query capabilities are one of its strongest features, allowing users to extract specific data from large databases efficiently
- Allows you to manage database permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify data

## Overview of SQL's Different Categories

### 1. Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL focuses on defining and managing a database's structure. This covers building, editing, and deleting tables, indexes, views, and other database structures. Unlike Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands, which deal with real data, DDL instructions are concerned with metadata—the database's structure and design. DDL is used when you create, modify, or delete a table, as well as to define relationships between tables. These commands are executed as standalone statements and do not require committing because DDL commands make modifications that are automatically committed.

- The `CREATE` command is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. It defines the structure and the relationships between these objects.

- The `ALTER` command is used to modify an existing database object. You can use it to add, delete, or modify columns in a table, or to change the properties of a database object.

- The `DROP` command is used to delete an existing database object. When you drop a table, all the data within it is also deleted, so it should be used with caution.

- The `TRUNCATE` command removes all rows from a table, effectively resetting it to its empty state, but it does not delete the table structure. This command is often faster than using the `DELETE` command because it doesn't generate individual row delete operations.

#### Examples of Each Command in a Simple Database Schema

To better understand how these DDL commands work in practice, let’s consider a simple database schema for a company that tracks employees and departments.

1. **Creating a Database Schema**
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Departments (
    DepartmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DepartmentName VARCHAR(100)
    );

    CREATE TABLE Employees (
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    HireDate DATE,
    DepartmentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (DepartmentID) REFERENCES Departments(DepartmentID)
    );
    ```
    In this schema, we have two tables: `Departments` and `Employees`. The `Departments` table contains information about different departments, and the `Employees` table contains employee details. The `DepartmentID` in the `Employees` table is a foreign key that references the `DepartmentID` in the `Departments` table, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

2. **Altering the Schema**

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE Employees
    ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
    ```
    After creating the `Employees` table, we realized that we also need to store the employees' email addresses. The `ALTER` command allows us to add the `Email` column to the existing `Employees` table.

3. **Dropping a Table**

    ```sql
    DROP TABLE Departments;
    ```
    If the company decides to restructure and no longer needs the `Departments` table, the `DROP` command can be used to remove it from the database entirely.

4. **Truncating a Table**

    ```sql
    TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
    ```
    If the company wants to retain the `Employees` table structure but clear out all the current employee records (perhaps to prepare for a new data import), the `TRUNCATE` command is ideal.


### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DDL focuses on managing and manipulating the data stored in a database's tables. While Data Definition Language (DDL) is concerned with the database's structure, Data Management Language (DML) works directly with the data itself, allowing you to insert new entries, update current data, and delete records that are no longer required. Unlike DDL commands, DML commands do not automatically commit changes to the database; instead, they are typically conducted within a transaction, allowing changes to be reversed if necessary.

-  The `INSERT` command is used to add new records (rows) to a database table. Each new row is inserted as a separate entry, with the data specified for each column in the table.

- The `UPDATE` command is used to modify existing records in a database table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns for rows that match a specific condition.

- The `DELETE` command is used to remove one or more rows from a database table. The rows to be deleted are identified by a condition specified in the WHERE clause.

#### Examples of Each Command in a Simple Database Schema

To better understand how DML commands work, let's continue using our simple database schema from the DDL section, focusing on the `Employees` table.

1. **Inserting Data into the Table**

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, HireDate, DepartmentID, Email)
    VALUES (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', '2024-03-10', 1, 'jane.smith@example.com');
    ```
    This `INSERT` command adds a new record for Jane Smith into the `Employees` table, capturing her personal details and associating her with a department.

2. **Update Existing Data**

    ```sql
    UPDATE Employees
    SET DepartmentID = 3
    WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
    ```
    After Jane Smith transfers to a different department, this `UPDATE` command changes her `DepartmentID` to 3 in the `Employees` table, reflecting her new department.

3. **Deleting Data from the Table**

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = 2;
    ```
    If Jane Smith leaves the company, this `DELETE` command removes her record from the `Employees` table, ensuring that her data is no longer stored in the system.

### 3. Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL is used to query and retrieve information from a database. DML modifies data, whereas DQL selects and displays data contained in database tables. The `SELECT` command is the foundation of DQL and knowing it is required for efficient data querying. Unlike other SQL queries, DQL commands are typically read-only, which means they do not modify the data but rather obtain it for viewing or subsequent processing.

#### Examples of `SELECT` Command in a Simple Database Schema

To demonstrate how the `SELECT` command works in practice, let's continue using our simple database schema with the `Employees` and `Departments` tables.

1. **Basic Data Retrieval**

    ```sql
    SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName FROM Employees;
    ```
    This basic `SELECT` statement fetches the `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, and `LastName` columns from the `Employees` table, showing a list of all employees.

2. **Filtering Data with `WHERE`**

    ```sql
    SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees
    WHERE HireDate > '2023-01-01';
    ```
    This query retrieves the first and last names of employees hired after January 1, 2023, filtering the results based on the hire date.

3. **Using Aggregate Functions**

    ```sql
    SELECT AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary FROM Employees;
    ```
    This query calculates the average salary of all employees in the Employees table, providing a single summary value labeled as `AverageSalary`.

4. **Joining Tables to Retrieve Related Data**

    ```sql
    SELECT Employees.FirstName, Employees.LastName, Departments.DepartmentName
    FROM Employees
    INNER JOIN Departments ON Employees.DepartmentID = Departments.DepartmentID;
    ```
    This query joins the `Employees` and `Departments` tables to display each employee's first name, last name, and the name of their department.

5.  **Sorting Results with `ORDER BY`**
    
    ```sql
    SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Employees
    ORDER BY HireDate DESC;
    ```
    This query retrieves the first and last names of employees, sorting the results by `HireDate` in descending order, so the most recently hired employees appear first.


### 4. Data Control Language (DCL) and Transaction Control Language (TCL)

Data Control Language (DCL) and Transaction Control Language (TCL) are two important subsets of SQL that focus on managing database access and controlling transactions. While DCL deals with permissions and security, TCL ensures the integrity and consistency of database transactions. The main DCL commands are `GRANT` and `REVOKE` while main commands of TCL are `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK` and `SAVEPOINT`.

-  The `GRANT` command is used to assign permissions to users or roles, allowing them to perform specific actions on database objects such as tables, views, or procedures.
- The `REVOKE` command is used to remove previously granted permissions from a user or role, thereby restricting their access to certain database objects.
- The `COMMIT` command is used to save all the changes made during the current transaction to the database. Once a transaction is committed, the changes become permanent and visible to other users.
- The `ROLLBACK` command undoes all changes made during the current transaction, reverting the database to its state before the transaction began. It is useful for discarding unwanted changes or recovering from errors.
- The `SAVEPOINT` command is used to set a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back. This allows for partial rollback within a transaction without undoing the entire transaction.

#### Examples of DCL & TCL Commands in Practice

1. **Granting Permissions**

    ```sql
    GRANT UPDATE ON Employees TO hr_manager;
    ```
    This command grants the `hr_manager` role the ability to update records in the `Employees` table, allowing HR managers to make changes to employee data.

2. **Revoking Permissions**

    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT ON Employees FROM temp_user;
    ```
    If `temp_user` should no longer have read access to the `Employees` table, this command revokes their `SELECT` permission.

3. **Using `COMMIT` in a Transaction**

    ```sql
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.05 WHERE DepartmentID = 1;
    COMMIT;
    ```
    This sequence starts a transaction, updates the salaries of all employees in department 1 by increasing them by 5%, and then commits the changes, making them permanent.

4. **Using `ROLLBACK` to undo changes**

    ```sql
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    DELETE FROM Employees WHERE EmployeeID = 10;
    ROLLBACK;
    ```
    After starting a transaction and deleting an employee record with `EmployeeID` = 10, the `ROLLBACK` command is issued, undoing the deletion and restoring the record.

5. **Using `SAVEPOINT`**

    ```sql 
    BEGIN TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE Employees SET Salary = Salary * 1.10 WHERE EmployeeID = 5;
    SAVEPOINT after_first_update;
    ```
    In this transaction, after updating the salary for `EmployeeID` = 5, a savepoint is created.
